# Natours Application

Built using Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JS & Vue. Includes frontend and backend development.

## I accomplished most of the proposed challenges on this course:

### API:

- Implement restriction that users can only review a tour that they have actually booked.
- Implement nested booking routed.
- Improve tour dates: add a participants and a soldOut field to each date. When a user books, they need to select one of the dates.
- Implement advanced authentication features: confirm user email, keep users logged in with refresh tokens, implement two-factor authentication.

### Frontend:

- Implement a sign up form.
- On the tour detail page, if a user has taken a tour, allow them add a review directly on the website.
- Implement "like tour" functionality, with favourite tour page section.
- On the user account page, implement "My Reviews" page, where all reviews are displayed and a user can edit them. (Implemented using Vue).
